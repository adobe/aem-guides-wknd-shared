Our tours are primarily for hardcore moutain biking enthusiasts but can be specialized to the interests and abilities of each group. Ride fast rolling trails or attempt some of the world famous logs and ladders.&lt;/p>&#xa;"

                itinerary="&lt;h2>&lt;b>Day 1 - Beginning on Lost Lake and Westside trails&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>We get right into the epic trails by beginning our adventure on Whistler's Lost Lake Trails, some of the most famous single track in the world. There will be rocks and roots throughout the terrain so be alert and welcome the challenge. Leave it to our experts to build a plan that will cover the best trails based on the conditions at the time of the tour. Remember to stop every once in awhile and soak up the views and take a few pictures to bring home for bragging rights!&amp;nbsp; We'll make our way to the Westside trails by the late afternoon.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>Day 2 - Experience the Incredibly Scenic Valley Trail&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>On the second day, we'll get to enjoy another aspect of what separates Whistler from other moutain biking destinations: incredible vistas. The unmatched scenery of the Valley Trail is awe-inspiring. Put in work to get through some pretty tough climbs into some remote areas and you'll quickly understand why it'll all be worth it once you reach the summit: the views from the top are world-class.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
