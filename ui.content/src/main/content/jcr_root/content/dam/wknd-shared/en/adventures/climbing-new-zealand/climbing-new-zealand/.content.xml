                itinerary="&lt;h2>&lt;b>Day 1 - It's climb time&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>We depart and end from a central meeting spot in the town of Fauchere.&amp;nbsp; From there we'll be driving 30-50 minutes to the climbing site. On our way there, we'll go over important safety and climbing procedures. After arriving at trailhead, we will confirm all safety and personal climbing equipment (shoes, harness, helmets, belay devises, and more). Our hike to the climbing area will be between 5 minutes to an hour based on where we decide to climb and the desires of the group. On the rock, we will spend about 6 hours climbing.&amp;nbsp; We'll go over different bouldering and climbing techniques first, fundamentals of setting anchors, belay systems and hardware,. Then, we'll make our way to the top.&amp;nbsp; Once we get there, you'll find the view to be spectactular and the sense of accomplishment even better.&amp;nbsp; But as they say, what goes up must come down. We now face another challenge - rappelling back down. But after a day of learning and applying our skills, we will be very comfortable on the mountain and with our abilities.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>Day 2 - Up the world's highest waterfall climb&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>Now it's time to satiate your inner-adrenaline junkie.&amp;nbsp; We're going up behind a 60m waterfall to the top of Wanaka. You’ll be pushed to reach the highest point, both mentally and physically, with overhangs to get you there. Enjoy the incredible views of surrounding lakes and mountains once you reach summit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;"
