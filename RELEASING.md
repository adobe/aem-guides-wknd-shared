# Release Process

## Prerequisites

* You must have commit rights on this repository.
* You must have deploy rights to [Sonatype's SS Repository Hosting (OSSRH)][https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html].

### Setup

In your Maven settings.xml file (`~/.m2/settings.xml`), add a server entry with the id `ossrh`. The username is your [OSSRH](https://issues.sonatype.org/projects/OSSRH/issues) username/Sonatype JIRA ID.

The password should only be [stored encrypted](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html#How_to_encrypt_server_passwords):

    <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                          https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
        ...
        <servers>
            <server>
                <id>ossrh</id>
                <username>jirausername</username>
                <password>*****</password>
            </server>
        </servers>
        ...
    </settings>

These credentials are used to deploy to [OSSRH][https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html].

In addition you need to setup [GPG](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html) to create OpenPGP signatures. After installing https://www.gnupg.org/download/ you need to create key pair (if you don't have one yet) and make sure that the public key is distributed via hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net.

It is recommended that your private key is protected with a passphrase. You can persist the passphrase in the settings.xml as well

     <server>
         <!-- has the passphrase for the gpg signing in encrypted format: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/sign-mojo.html#passphraseServerId -->
         <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
         <!-- passphrase for your private key -->
         <password>****</password>
    </server>
    
### Java 8

You must use Java 8 when peforming the Maven release.

### Prior to release

Make sure that all issues assigned to the current milestone have been closed and all necessary pull requests have been merged and closed out.  Don't proceed with the release until you know what you're releasing. ;)

### Release Process

1. Make sure that the issues and pull requests are associated with the proper milestone -- anything open for the current release should be moved to the next release, either minor or patch depending on the nature of the issue.

2. Run the release: `mvn release:prepare` followed by `mvn release:perform`. You may need to pass `-Dgpg.passphrase=****` if your passphrase is not persisted in your `settings.xml`.

> Note* for MacOS it may be necessary to include the following in your `~/.bash_profile` if you get an error like "Inappropriate ioctl for device macOS"

```
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
```

3. Go to https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd/releases and edit the release tag and update the release text. Add compiled AEM Packages for AEM as a Cloud Service (default build) and special classic build for 6.x.x.

4. Log into https://oss.sonatype.org/ and close the staging repository. Closing the staging repo will automatically push the artifacts to Maven Central after a small delay (4 hours for all mirrors to catch up)

5. Add a release announcement (and any other docs) to the documentation site.
